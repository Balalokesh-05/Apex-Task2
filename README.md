🛠️ Contact & To-Do Web App
This project is a simple yet functional web-based application that includes two main features:

🔹 Contact Form
A responsive and user-friendly contact form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input:

Name

Email

Phone number

Message

The form is styled for clarity and ease of use, and is structured with semantic HTML and clean CSS.

🔹 To-Do List
A fully functional To-Do List that allows users to:

Add tasks

Mark tasks as complete

The to-do list is built using vanilla JavaScript, and is neatly organized for easy readability and interaction.
